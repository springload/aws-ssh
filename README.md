### What it is

This program goes through all available AWS accounts in parallel and determines

IP addresses of ec2 instances. It also detects so-called "bastion" instances.

There are the following EC2 instance tags that change behaviour:

1. (Deprecated) If a bastion instance has tag "Global" with value "yes", "true" or "1", then aws-ssh will use it for all VPCs. If there are multiple bastion instances, it chooses the instance that has the most common match in name.
2. "x-aws-ssh-global" - same as the above
3. "x-aws-ssh-user" - sets the ssh username in the config.
4. "x-aws-ssh-port" - sets the ssh port in the config.

Any comments and especially pull requests are highly appreciated.

### Build

You'll need go>=1.16. Note that this project uses `go.mod`, so the project has to be cloned somewhere outside of the `GOPATH` directory.
Or just use provided `Dockerfile`.
